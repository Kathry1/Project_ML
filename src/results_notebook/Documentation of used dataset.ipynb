    "# ü©∫ MUSIC Dataset - Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure  \n",
    "\n",
    "##  **Dataset Summary**\n",
    "The MUSIC dataset (Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure) is a publicly available medical dataset from **PhysioNet** that contains clinical data from **992 patients** with **chronic heart failure (CHF)**. The dataset includes **103 variables**, covering patient demographics, vital signs, lab results, medical history, and medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ** Dataset Source**\n",
    "- **Name:** MUSIC (Muerte S√∫bita en Insuficiencia Card√≠aca Cr√≥nica)\n",
    "- **Source:** [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)\n",
    "- **Access:** Free for research and educational purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **Dataset Structure & Key Features**\n",
    "The dataset consists of **numerical and categorical features**. Below is an overview of the key columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1Ô∏è Patient Demographics**\n",
    "- `Patient ID` ‚Üí Unique identifier for each patient (not useful for modeling)\n",
    "- `Age` ‚Üí Patient's age (years)\n",
    "- `Gender (male=1)` ‚Üí 1 = Male, 0 = Female\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2Ô∏è Clinical Follow-up**\n",
    "- `Follow-up period from enrollment (days)` ‚Üí Number of days the patient was followed up in the study\n",
    "- `Exit of the study` ‚Üí Indicates if the patient left the study (many missing values)\n",
    "- `Cause of death` ‚Üí Patient's cause of death (target variable for classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3Ô∏è Target Variable (Multiclass Classification)**\n",
    "- `\"Cause of death\"` contains the following categories:\n",
    "  - `0` ‚Üí **Survivor (Alive)**\n",
    "  - `1` ‚Üí **Non-cardiac death**\n",
    "  - `2` ‚Üí **Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)**\n",
    "  - `3` ‚Üí **Pump failure death**\n",
    "- The goal is to classify patients into one of these **four categories** based on clinical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4Ô∏è Vital Signs & Lab Results**\n",
    "- `Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)`, `Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)` ‚Üí Blood pressure readings\n",
    "- `Body Mass Index (Kg/m2)` ‚Üí BMI of the patient\n",
    "- `Heart rate (bpm)`, `PR interval (ms)`, `QT interval (ms)` ‚Üí ECG-related metrics\n",
    "- `Pro-BNP (ng/L)`, `Troponin (ng/mL)`, `Creatinine (mmol/L)`, `Cholesterol (mmol/L)` ‚Üí Key lab test values\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5Ô∏è Medical History & Risk Factors**\n",
    "- `Diabetes (yes=1)`, `History of dyslipemia (yes=1)`, `History of hypertension (yes=1)`\n",
    "- `Prior Myocardial Infarction (yes=1)`, `Peripheral vascular disease (yes=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6Ô∏è Medications**\n",
    "- `Beta blockers (yes=1)`, `ACE inhibitors (yes=1)`, `Diuretics (yes=1)`, `Statins (yes=1)`, `Anticoagulants (yes=1)`\n",
    "- **Binary format:** `1 = Medication used`, `0 = Not used`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **Objective of Machine Learning Model**\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a **multiclass classification model** that predicts the **cause of death** based on clinical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable:** `Cause of death`\n",
    "  - `0` ‚Üí Patient is **alive**\n",
    "  - `1` ‚Üí **Non-cardiac death**\n",
    "  - `2` ‚Üí **Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)**\n",
    "  - `3` ‚Üí **Pump failure death**\n",
    "- **Approach:** Supervised Machine Learning (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score\n",
