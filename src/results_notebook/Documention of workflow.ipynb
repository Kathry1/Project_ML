    "# Documentation of the Notebook Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview of the Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a structured workflow for data analysis and machine learning modeling. The key steps in the process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and selecting important features.\n",
    "4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementing different machine learning models, optimizing hyperparameters, and comparing their performance.\n",
    "5. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Evaluating the impact of different features on model predictions.\n",
    "6. **Final Model Selection and Interpretation**: Choosing the best-performing model and interpreting its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Results and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Findings from EDA:**\n",
    "- The dataset contains several numerical and categorical features, which were visualized using histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand their distributions and relationships.\n",
    "- **Missing values** were identified in some variables. They were handled using imputation techniques such as mean/median replacement for numerical values and mode imputation for categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Feature distributions** indicated that some variables were skewed, but no explicit log transformation was applied.\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis** revealed that some features had strong correlations, suggesting potential redundancy, while others had weak relationships with the target variable.\n",
    "- **Class imbalance** was detected in the target variable, and it was addressed using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** and **class weight adjustments** to ensure balanced model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Insights from Data Visualization:**\n",
    "- **High correlation among features**: Some variables exhibited strong correlations, which could lead to multicollinearity issues in models like logistic regression.\n",
    "- **Distribution of categorical variables**: Some categorical features were analyzed, but no explicit one-hot encoding was applied.\n",
    "- **Target variable analysis**: The class imbalance was confirmed, leading to appropriate balancing techniques in the modeling phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Machine Learning Models - Results and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Models Implemented:**\n",
    "- **Baseline Model:** A simple model (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree) was trained to establish a benchmark.\n",
    "- **XGBoost:** An optimized gradient boosting model with hyperparameter tuning, known for handling structured data effectively.\n",
    "- **Random Forest:** A robust ensemble learning method used to evaluate feature importance and improve model stability.\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression:** A baseline classification model to compare against more complex methods.\n",
    "- **Blending Ensemble:** A combination of multiple models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) where predictions were averaged to enhance accuracy and robustness.\n",
