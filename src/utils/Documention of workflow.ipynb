    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a structured workflow for data analysis and machine learning modeling. The key steps in the process include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations.\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset through descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, encoding categorical variables, and selecting important features.\n",
    "4. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementing different machine learning models, optimizing hyperparameters, and comparing their performance.\n",
    "5. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Evaluating the impact of different features on model predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Results and Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Findings from EDA:**\n",
    "- The dataset contains several numerical and categorical features, which were visualized using histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to understand their distributions and relationships.\n",
    "- **Missing values** were identified in some variables. They were handled using imputation techniques such as mean/median replacement for numerical values and mode imputation for categorical variables.\n",
    "- **Feature distributions** indicated that some variables were skewed, but no explicit log transformation was applied.\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis** revealed that some features had strong correlations, suggesting potential redundancy, while others had weak relationships with the target variable.\n",
